# TS Tetris

This is a Tetris game that runs in HTML Canvas.
I just made this to learn some TypeScript over the summer. Very simple.

(Something is still weird about rotating near the right edge.
I will fix it some day soon...)

## Using

To compile:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

You can also just play it here on my website: https://hermoraun.io/tetris/

## TODO

* Don't draw in a tight loop when in menu or game over screen.
* Framerate independent mechanics?
